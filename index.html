  <p> Exceptionally excited about food? </p>

  <p> Need to <em> eat </em> EVERYDAY?! </p>

  <!-- that is if I can figure out how to create this -->
  
  <img src="./images/options.jpg"> 
<ul>
    <!--figured out that the index document is already in repos/Odin-Recipe so I would only need to 
        reference the folder located IN Odin-Recipe eg \pages\pho.html not the whole address.
        File Locations Moved (wasn't hard)

    <!--I need to review how to create the visible clickable text for the link
        HINT - the answer is NOT below-->
  
    <li><a href="./pages/pho.html"> Pho</a></li>
    <li><a href="./pages/salad.html"> Salad</a></li>
    <li><a href="./pages/coffee.html"> Coffee</a></li>

</ul>
